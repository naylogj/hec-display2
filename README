Version 2 of a Home Energy Centre using Raspberry Pi

This software displays:

Solar PV data
Solar Thermal (hot water) data
Curent Weather data


Work in progress.

aims are to:

rework the Resol collection code into Python [ done ] - no longer reliant on other code
develop the Resol collection code to use MQTT for sending data, so that I can split out the HEC display function from the data gathering functions [ done - the Solar Hot Water code now runs on a separate Raspberry Pi Zero in Python ] 
completely re-write the front end display code  - in progress - using the thingsboard.io service https://thingsboard.io
